AI-Based Automated Content Marketing Optimizer


ACADEMIC PROJECTS
? Spotify Clone	
		   
* Technologies : HTML,CSS

? Travel Blog Website 	
			   
* Technologies : HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT,DJANGO,DBSQLITE
* User friendly travel website in which the user can explore underrated locations by viewing posts by other users. The user can modify the posts they created(add, remove, update).
* Snake Game
* Technologies: Core Java
* Classic and interactive Snake game, built using Java including various concepts of  Event handling like Key Events, Mouse Events, usage of different packages like util, timer, random.
* AIRBNB

* AI Based Automated Content Marketing Optimizer
* Technologies: Python, Flask API, HTML ,Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
* AI-Based Automated Content Marketing Optimizer is a system that uses Artificial Intelligence to automatically generate, analyze, and optimize short-form marketing content for social media.
It employs the Google Gemini model to create multiple post versions, compare them, and predict engagement potential based on sentiment, tone, and emotional appeal.
The system also learns from previous content performance, continuously improving its predictions to help brands craft more effective, data-driven marketing posts.

* NATIVE LANGUAGE IDENTIFIER
* Technologies: Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, Librosa, Torchaudio, NumPy, Pandas, Flask (Web App)
* AI-based speech analysis project that automatically identifies the regional accent of a speaker from short audio recordings. The system uses two powerful approaches:
> MFCC Feature Extraction: Captures core acoustic properties of speech.
> HuBERT Transformer Embeddings: Extracts high-level phonetic patterns from pretrained speech transformers.
> These features are fed into a lightweight MLP classifier, which achieves up to 100% accuracy for sentence-level audio. The system also includes:
> Layer-wise HuBERT analysis to find which transformer layer captures accent cues best.
> Word vs Sentence comparison showing why longer utterances improve accent recognition.
> Cross-age generalization testing to evaluate how well adult-trained models perform on children's speech.







* DRIVER DROWSINESS DETECTION SYSTEM
        TECHNOLOGIES USED
o Languages: Python 3.8+
o Deep Learning: TensorFlow, Keras (CNN)
o Computer Vision: OpenCV (Haar Cascade Classifiers)
o GUI Framework: Tkinter, PIL (Pillow)
o Audio Processing: Pygame, NumPy
o Data Processing: NumPy, Pandas
o Visualization: Matplotlib
The Drowsy Driver Detection System is a real-time computer vision application combining Haar Cascade face/eye detection with a 3-layer CNN to identify driver drowsiness from webcam feeds. Processing at 15-30 FPS with 50-100ms latency, the system achieves 83.49% test accuracy on 1,450+ labeled eye images. It employs sequential decision logic requiring both eyes closed to increment a drowsiness score mapped to three alert levels: AWAKE (green, score <8), ALERT (orange, score 8-14 with audio alert), and DROWSY (red, score =15 with alarm). The CNN model trained over 15 epochs achieves 96.2% training and 85.7% validation accuracy with 82.1% precision and 84.3% recall. With a 476 KB model footprint, 25-40% CPU usage, and no GPU requirement, the system is deployable on embedded automotive hardware for fleet management, industrial monitoring, and safety-critical applications. The production-ready system includes configurable thresholds, real-time GUI visualization, and dual-tone audio alerts designed to prevent fatigue-induced accidents while minimizing false positives.
